# PCM_sensitivity

Plan:
- Simulate trees with extant and extinct tips
- Simulate trait evolution on those trees with different models
- Subsample trees using different regimes: extant vs. extinct
- Use PCMs to test whether trait evolution models are correctly identified
- Use post-hoc tests to identify whether using tips with higher phylogenetic or functional uniqueness affect model fit

To do:
- Simulate trees, varying the size of the phylogeny, the birth and death rates, the ratio of fossil to extant tips, and the temporal distribution of the fossils through time (W)
- Draft code to simulate traits on phylogenies using BM, OU, trend and AC/DC (Early Burst) models (B)
