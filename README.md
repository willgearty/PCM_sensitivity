# PCM_sensitivity

Plan:
- Simulate trees with extant and extinct tips
- Simulate trait evolution on those trees with different models
- Subsample trees using different regimes: extant vs. extinct
- Use PCMs to test whether trait evolution models are correctly identified
- Use post-hoc tests to identify whether using tips with higher phylogenetic or functional uniqueness affect model fit

To do:
- Simulate trees (W) -> two sets of births/deaths to test for tree shape (births and deaths both 1, and births 1 and deaths 0.25) and vary proportions of extant/extinct tips
- Model traits using mvMORPH (B) -> use parameter values from Slater et al. (2012), change the lowest value for Brownian motion from 0 to 0.1, try different values for theta for OU (the optimum value)
- Put together code for model fitting (P)
